I've been experimenting with various ways of extending Django models
with new fields and/or methods, without the co-operaton of the base
model, or jumping through any hoops to access the new attributes. The
result doesn't strike me as very Pythonic, but that suits me just fine.
Check out dob/models.py for a fairly concise doctest demonstrating what
this does.
