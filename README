I've been experimenting with various ways of extending Django models with new
fields and/or methods, without the co-operaton of the base model, or jumping
through any hoops to access the new attributes. The result doesn't strike me
as very Pythonic, but that suits me just fine. Check out dob/models.py for a
fairly concise doctest demonstrating what this does.

Most of the techniques within were generalized from:
